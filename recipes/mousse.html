    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>3 ½ ounces dark chocolate, chopped</b></li>
        <li><b>1 tablespoon butter</b></li>
        <li><b>2 tablespoons water</b></li>
        <li><b>⅛ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</b></li>
        <li><b>1 tiny pinch salt</b></li>
        <li><b>2 large egg yolks</b></li>
        <li><b>2 tablespoons water</b></li>
        <li><b>1 tablespoon white sugar</b></li>
        <li><b>½ cup heavy whipping cream, chilled</b></li>
        <li><b>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, chilled</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b> 
        Bring a saucepan of water to a simmer over low heat. Place chocolate, butter, 2 tablespoons water, ground chipotle pepper, and salt in a heatproof bowl; set bowl over the simmering water. When the butter melts, whisk the chocolate mixture gently until smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b> 
        Whisk egg yolks, 2 tablespoons water, and sugar in another heatproof bowl over the same pan of simmering water until egg yolk mixture is foamy and hot to the touch, about 3 minutes. Pour hot egg mixture into warm chocolate mixture, whisk until smooth, and set over a bowl of ice to chill. Whisk constantly until mixture has cooled to room temperature or slightly cooler.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3</b>
        Pour 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon cold cream into a chilled metal bowl; whisk until cream holds soft peaks. Place about half the whipped cream into the cooled chocolate mixture; gently fold the cream into the chocolate. Repeat with remaining half of whipped cream, folding gently until nearly all the streaks have disappeared. Divide mousse into 4 6-ounce ramekins.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4</b> 
        Cover each ramekin with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours (up to overnight) before serving.</li>
